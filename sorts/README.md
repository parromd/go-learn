# go sorts :rocket:
This was supposed to be a learning exercise on Go generics, implementing a generic sorter class that could sort any type that implements `comparable`, but I don't think that's possible quite yet (at least easily).  
So I ended up just implementing a couple of sorting algos to practice dealing with slices :shrug:  
Onward!
